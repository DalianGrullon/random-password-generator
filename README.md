## Why I Made It and What I Learned

- Why:
    - I created this random password generator to practice my skills in JavaScript.
- What I learned:
    - In creating this generator, I familiarized myself with the functionality of:
        - for loops
        - while loops
        - if/else statements
        - prompt() and alert() functions in JavaScript
        - conditional operators such as strict equality ===, or ||, and &&, NOT !
        - defining functions
        - global vs. local scope
        - Random generation through the use of Math.random
        - Number() to turn a string into a number
        - addEventListeners() to sense on clicks
